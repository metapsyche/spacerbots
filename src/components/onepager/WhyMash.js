      <p>Over 40 years ago, music videos changed how fans experience content from their favorite bands and artists. Since then, film soundtracks, video game scores, anime opening songs and more continue to blow up and inspire masses.</p>
      <p>But of course these music videos are created and owned by someone other than you... until now.</p>
      <p>MASH is not a record label and its not a typical NFT marketplace. Content creators ranging from novice bedroom producers to award-winning artists are sharing their work so NFT collectors can join the creative experience by mashing to create the videos they love.</p>
